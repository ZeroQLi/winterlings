# Winterlings, A site to view hack club winter wonderland projects

## what was winter wonderland anyway?

Over the course of 10 days starting 14th febuary 2023, over 200 hack clubbers from all around the world came together in the hackclub [slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) to build their dream hardware project.

## okay, so why this site

This is just a attempt by me to make a visual site to view everybody's projects

## tech stack

This is a static Astro.js site using tailwindcss and svelte.

# development
```
git clone https://github.com/ZeroQLi/winterlings.git
cd winterlings
pnpm install
pnpm dev

```
